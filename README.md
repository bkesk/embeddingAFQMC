# Embedding Tools for AFQMC

![Build and Test](https://github.com/bkesk/embeddingAFQMC/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

A basic Python package for building orbitally-based embedding
Hamiltonians in 2nd quantized form.
These tools were developed for local embedding AFQMC [B. Eskridge, H. Krakauer, S. Zhang *J. Chem. Theory Comput.* 2019, 15, 7, 3949â€“3959](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b01244),
but can be used for general frozen orbital transformations.
The tools included are designed for AFQMC calculations, but the
tools are applicable to other methods as well.

## Usage:

The primary interface to the embedding / frozen orbital transformation is the `make_embedding_H` function.
Here is a minimal example of using this function to freeze the 1s electrons in an Oxygen atom:

```Python
from pyscf import gto,scf

from embedding ipmort make_embedding_H

from embedding.cholesky import cholesky
from embedding.cholesky.integrals.gto import GTOIntegralGenerator

# perform an SCF calculation for reference wavefunction
mol = gto.M(atom='''O 0.0 0.0 0.0''',
            basis='ccpvdz',
            spin=2)

mf = scf.ROHF(mol)
mf.kernel()

# use canonical orbital basis
basis = mf.mo_coeff

# get GTO-basis integrals
S = mol.intor('int1e_ovlp')
K = mol.intor('int1e_kin') + mol.intor('int1e_nuc')

# compute Cholesky vectors in GTO basis
gto_gen = GTOIntegralGenerator(mol)
numcholesky,choleskyAO = cholesky(gto_gen,tol=1.0E-6)

# create frozen orbital Hamiltonian
twoBody,numCholeskyActive,oneBody,S,E0 = pel.make_embedding_H(nfc=1,
                                                              tol=1.0e-8,
                                                              C=basis,
                                                              twoBody=choleskyAO,
                                                              oneBody=K,
                                                              S=S,
                                                              transform_only=True)
```

## Legacy version

Recently, the embeddingAFQMC Library was reorganized, and some redundant and/or 
deprecated code has been romved.
A legacy version of the embedding exists in the `legacy` branch for code that still uses it.
Some "helper" tools from `legacy` may be updated and pushed back into the main branch.

## TODO:

- General
  - change print to logging.info (or similar)
  - define and configure logger
  - add test for correct ordering of orbitals
  - add a Dockerfile

- make_embedding_H:
  - no need to return number of Cholesky vectors

- cholesky:
  - add ability to use comlpex-valued orbitals

- `legacy` branch:
  - update tools for analyzing local orbitals for `main` branch
